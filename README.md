## Documentation

Read the full API and view the demo here (coming soon).

The documentation in this repository is supplemental to the official Predix documentation, which is continuously updated and maintained by the Predix documentation team. Go to [http://predix.io](http://predix.io)  to see the official Predix documentation.


## Local Development

From the component's directory...

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp sass
```

From the component's directory, to start a local server run:

```
$ gulp serve
```

The root of that server (e.g. http://localhost:8080/) will automatically open in your default browser with the API documentation page and interactive working examples.

`gulp serve` also runs `gulp watch` concurrently so that when you make a change to your source files and save them, your preview will be updated in any browsers you have opened and turned on in LiveReload.
